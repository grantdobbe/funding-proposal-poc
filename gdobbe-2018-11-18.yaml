project description: |
  I would like to run a soldering workshop for the local Girl Scout troop in my town. I can use the soldering irons and solder suckers from a local hackerspace, but I need flux, solder, and some kit projects for them to work on. I also want to go to the local thrift store and buy a bunch of old electronics, like TVs, radios, and the like so that they can practice desoldering components before they start soldering on their kit projects.
# what's your goal?
goal: |
  I live in rural Wisconsin, and this girl scout troop doesn't have a lot of funds or opportunities for technology education. I feel very strongly about STEM education, especially for girls, and I want to make sure they have the same opportunities I had growing up to learn about electronics.

funding amount: 250
  # how are you planning to use those funds?
